Once upon a time...

[Chapter 1]
  It seemed as if the zombies came from all directions.  They even were falling from the heavens.  Was this God's punishment for the sins of man?
  Who honestly knows, because I sure as hell don't.  I never in my life thought I would see the dead raining from the skies.  But here we are, 
  fighting for our lives.  Who would have ever imagined this happening to the entire planet?
  
  The WHO didn't alert us when they started falling in Cambodia.  Nor did they alert us when they started falling in Japan.  It wasn't until
  they started falling all over Europe, Asia, and Africa.  But by then, there were monsoons of undead cadavers pooring all over the streets of 
  New York, Seattle, Los Angeles, Miami, and everywhere between.
  
  Where on Earth were these things coming from?  This seems to be straight out of a sci-fi movie.  NASA confirmed that they were approaching 
  our atmosphere from the deepest parts of space.  But nobody saw them coming.  It was as if a portal opened up around our planet and flooded us 
  with billions of alien zombies.  Many thought they would just burn up in our atmosphere as they plummeted straight to the ground.  Flaming and 
  flesh falling from their bones, it was as if their bodies endured the cruelest of eternal torment.
  
  Now more than half of the world's population has been wiped out.  What are we to do to rebuild our civilization?  No matter how many we kill, 
  they just keep coming.  These space zombies finally finished raining down on us and the militaries around the globe have tried to wipe out as 
  many as they could.  Who could have prepared us for this?  Nothing I have ever read in books could cover this strange catastrophe 
  of epidemic, bubonic proportions.  And I'm not sure we will ever contain it or recover from this.
  
  All we can do now is fight for our lives.  We must fight for our survival.  We must kill or be killed.  If we fail, then the human race will 
  finally be eradicated and Mother Nature will have to correct herself...or the dead will finally rule this world.

They all died happily after.
The End
